# object-color-detection-tool
A modern, browser-based real-time color detection tool built with Python, Flask, and OpenCV. It lets you start your webcam, target an object inside a circular area, detect its dominant color, display HEX/RGB codes (click-to-copy), and save colors into a history panel for later use â€” all in a clean, professional UI.
